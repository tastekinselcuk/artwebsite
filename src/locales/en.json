    "title": "About the Artist",
    "intro": "I am an artist who bridges worlds—the ancient and the contemporary, the fluid and the structured, the organic and the geometric.",
    "para1": "Through the centuries-old Turkish art of Ebru marbling, I explore the unpredictable beauty of water and pigment. Each piece is a meditation on impermanence and the acceptance of what emerges from chaos.",
    "para2": "My photography practice complements this fluidity with deliberate composition—finding poetry in architecture, light, and negative space. Where Ebru embraces spontaneity, photography demands intention. Together, they form a dialogue about control and surrender.",
    "para3": "Based between tradition and innovation, I create work that invites contemplation and celebrates the duality of the creative process.",
    "contact": "Get in Touch",
    "quote": "Art is not about perfection—it's about presence. It's about showing up to the blank page, the still water, the empty frame, and trusting what wants to emerge."
